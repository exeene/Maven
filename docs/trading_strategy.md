## 🛠️ Steps to Add Trading Strategies

Follow these simple steps to configure your trading strategies:

### 1️⃣ Define Your Strategy in JSON

Create a JSON file that outlines your trading logic. Here's an example template:

```json
{
  "strategyName": "Momentum Trader",
  "description": "A strategy focused on trading based on momentum indicators.",
  "parameters": {
    "movingAveragePeriod": 14,
    "buyThreshold": 1.5,
    "sellThreshold": -1.5
  },
  "rules": [
    {
      "condition": "momentum > buyThreshold",
      "action": "BUY"
    },
    {
      "condition": "momentum < sellThreshold",
      "action": "SELL"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 2️⃣ Save Your JSON File

Save the JSON file in a location accessible by your AI assistant, such as the `/strategies` directory in your project.

### 3️⃣ Load the Strategy in Code

Use the SDK's built-in function to load your strategy:

```javascript
const aiWaifu = require('ai-waifu-sdk');

// Load the strategy
const strategy = require('./strategies/momentumTrader.json');
aiWaifu.loadStrategy(strategy);

console.log('Strategy loaded successfully! ✅');
```

### 4️⃣ Activate the Strategy

Activate the strategy and begin trading:

```javascript
aiWaifu.activateStrategy('Momentum Trader');
console.log('Momentum Trader is now active! 🚀');
```
