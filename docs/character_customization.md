### 2. **Appearance Settings** 💄

Customize the visual aspects of your Waifu. Supports **CSS** or **WebGL** styling.

```yaml

    pitch_variance=0.3, 🎶
    speech_rate=1.1, ⏱️
    emotional_range=0.8, 😍
    accent="neutral" 🗣️
)
```

- **Pitch Variance**: The variation in pitch (0.0 is neutral).
- **Speech Rate**: How fast they speak (1.0 is normal).
- **Emotional Range**: How expressive the voice is.
- **Accent**: Adjust the accent, e.g., "neutral", "british", "japanese".

---

### 4. **Trading Persona** 💹

Define how your Waifu interacts with the market, such as their strategy, risk preferences, and trading tools.

```javascript
{
  "trading_profile": {
    "analysis_depth": "deep", 📊
    "update_frequency": "real_time", ⏳
    "risk_indicators": ["RSI", "MACD", "ORDER_BOOK"], 📉

### 2. **Day Trader Character** 📈

```javascript

  "meme_coin_alert": true 🤑
}
```

- **Reaction Speed**: They react instantly to market changes.
- **Market Monitors**: Keep an eye on specific trading pairs.
- **Meme Coin Alert**: Special notifications for meme coins.

---

## ⚡ **Best Practices** 💡

- **Balance Personality Traits**: Ensure the traits are coherent and not conflicting (e.g., don’t make them "risk-tolerant" and "cautious" at the same time).
- **Test Voice Parameters**: Different market conditions may require different emotional ranges or speech rates to make the assistant feel more responsive.
- **Align Strategy with Risk Profile**: Make sure their trading profile matches the user's risk tolerance.
- **Use Theme Inheritance**: Maintain a consistent style by inheriting a base profile.

```yaml
# Inherit from base profile
extends: "default_professional" 📊
overrides:
  humor_level: 0.3 😶
  crisis_response: "calm_reassurance" 🧘‍♀️
```
